Explaining the BigQuery Daily Update DAG

This Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), defined in Apache Airflow, is designed to perform daily updates to the sinch_datasets.events table in Google BigQuery. Here's a breakdown of the components and functionality of this DAG:

1. Import Statements
   - datetime: For handling dates and times, specifically to define the start date and retry intervals.
   - DAG: The core component of Airflow to define a DAG.
   - BigQueryExecuteQueryOperator: An operator to execute queries on BigQuery.

2. Default Arguments (default_args):
   - owner: Specifies the owner of the DAG, in this case, 'airflow'.
   - depends_on_past: Indicates that the current task does not depend on the success of the previous runs, set to False.
   - start_date: The date when the DAG should start running, set to January 1, 2024.
   - email_on_failure: If set to True, Airflow would send an email on task failure. It's set to False.
   - email_on_retry: If set to True, Airflow would send an email on task retry. It's set to False.
   - retries: The number of retries that should be attempted on failure, set to 1.
   - retry_delay: The delay between retries, set to 5 minutes.

3. DAG Definition:
   - The DAG is defined with the ID bigquery_daily_update_sinch_datasets_events, using the previously defined default_args.
   - description: Provides a brief description of the DAG's purpose.
   - schedule_interval: Defines how often the DAG should run, set to run daily (timedelta(days=1)).
   - start_date: Confirms the start date for the DAG, although it's also defined in the default arguments.
   - catchup: When set to False, prevents Airflow from running the DAG for any dates before the current date that haven't been executed.
   - tags: Helps with organizing and finding the DAG within the Airflow UI.

4. BigQueryExecuteQueryOperator (t1):
   - Executes a SQL query on BigQuery to select and transform data from the bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.events table.
   - The query truncates the created_at timestamp to the hour and counts sessions, purchase events, and total events, grouping the results by created_at, traffic_source, and postal_code.
   - Filters events to include only those from the last three days.
   - The results are appended to the sinch_datasets.events table in the sinch-challenge-yago-novaes project.
   - write_disposition: Set to WRITE_APPEND to append the results to the table.
   - create_disposition: Set to CREATE_IF_NEEDED, allowing the table to be created if it does not exist.
   - use_legacy_sql: Indicates whether to use Legacy SQL (True) or Standard SQL (False), set to False for this query.

This DAG automates the process of updating the sinch_datasets.events table in BigQuery on a daily basis, ensuring that the data remains fresh and up to date for analysis and reporting purposes.
